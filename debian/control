Description: Cookie auditing tool for wired and wireless networks
 Cookie Cadger helps identify information leakage from applications that utilize
 insecure HTTP GET requests.
 .
 Web providers have started stepping up to the plate since Firesheep was
 released in 2010. Today, most major websites can provide SSL/TLS during all
 transactions, preventing cookie data from leaking over wired Ethernet or
 insecure Wi-Fi. But the fact remains that Firesheep was more of a toy than a
 tool. Cookie Cadger is the first open-source pen-testing tool ever made for
 intercepting and replaying specific insecure HTTP GET requests into a browser.
 .
 Cookie Cadgerâ€™s Request Enumeration Abilities
 .
 Cookie Cadger is a graphical utility which harnesses the power of the
 Wireshark suite and Java to provide a fully cross-platform, entirely open-
 source utility which can monitor wired Ethernet, insecure Wi-Fi, or load a
 packet capture file for offline analysis.
